# Assumptions

 * You believe in financial risk taking. <br /><small>(You're not 40 after-all)</small>
 * You don't really want to work at a large company right out of college.

# Share Your Work
<!--
# You do all of this work in college
## you write papers
## do projects
## and generally make cool shit
# but all of it just sits there
# why don't you share it?
-->

!SLIDE 15seconds bullets 5
# Excuses for not sharing:

 * It's too hard
 * My work sucks
 * No one cares

!SLIDE 15seconds bullets 6
# Lies!

 * takes 30 minutes
 * you will actually come back to it
 * 90% of the time, no one cares

!SLIDE 15seconds smbullets 7
# But that 10% of the time can get you to:

 * start a company 
 * work with really cool people (excuse to drink beer) 
 * make you super-duper internet famous.

# Another Issue

## In this digital age, everything you do leaves digital residue online.

## Instead of letting this digital residue define you

## create your own self-image on the web

!SLIDE 15seconds 9

# Example

!SLIDE 15seconds 10

# moar talking 0

!SLIDE 15seconds 11

# moar talking 1

!SLIDE 15seconds 12

# moar talking 2

# Step 1!

 * Get a website. <br /><small>Simplest Way: [Github Pages][ghp] and a domain name.</small>
 * Put your name on it, and five pieces of information about yourself.

[ghp]: http://pages.github.com/

!SLIDE 15seconds bullets 14
# Places not to put your website:

 * Your csc user page
 * some obscure url

# Step 2.

 * Pick 3 things you have done.
 * Clean them up, write a README
 * put them somewhere <small>(github repos, a folder on your site)</small>
 * Link to them from your webpage

!SLIDE 15seconds 17
# So you've got a website...

# What now?

## First off: Link to your page from wherever you exist online <small>(Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, whatever.)</small>
